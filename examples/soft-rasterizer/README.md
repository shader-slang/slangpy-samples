# Soft Triangle Rasterizer

This example takes the forward rasterizer example (fwd-rasterizer) with color
dependent on boolean inside/outside value, and turns it into a soft triangle
rasterizer with fuzzy edges. It then extends it to show how to use autodiff to
recover the vertices of a pre-rendered triangle.

## Overview

This example feeds 3 reference vertices to a forward rasterizer to generate a
reference image. It then trains using this rasterizer so that, given 3 random
vertices, it can learn from the reference image what the reference vertices
are.

Optimization loop:

- For each pixel coordinate in the reference image:
    - Generate gradients from rasterizer and accumulate them into a tensor
- Optimize the vertices using the gradients (gradient descent)
- Display the triangle that is rasterized by the trained vertices

## Architecture Notes

### Convergence

While the triangle appears as a solid green region with a soft edge, the actual
data generated by the rasterizer extends outside of the visual (0, 1) range.
These values allow for a gradient across all samples, allowing the gradients to
converge.

### Atomic Gradient Writes

The example accumulates gradients from many samples into three vertices
simultaneously across multiple threads. To avoid overwriting and invalidating
the gradient values, the example uses an AtomicTensor to avoid a race condition.

## Usage

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-l] [-r] [-p PARAMS] [-t TARGET] [-d DIMS] [-g LEARN] [-m MAX] [-c]

'soft-rasterizer' is a SlangPy example. Demonstrates optimizing vertex parameters using gradient diffusion to match those of a
previously rasterized reference soft-edged triangle. Many parameters for the vertices and gradient descent are exposed as command
line arguments for experimentation, but it's easy to provide values that do not resolve. (Defaults should resolve.)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l, --log             log the primal and gradient values to console (default: False)
  -r, --random          randomize initial vertex parameters; overrides initial vertex parameters (default: False)
  -p PARAMS, --params PARAMS
                        initial vertex parameters, as a string (default: (-1, 1), (-1, -3), (3, 1))
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        target/reference triangle vertices, as a string (default: (-0.75, 0.75), (-0.75, -0.75), (0.75, -0.75))
  -d DIMS, --dims DIMS  dimensions of the reference raserized image, DxD (default: 256)
  -g LEARN, --learn LEARN
                        learning rate for gradient descent (default: 0.01)
  -m MAX, --max MAX     maximum iterations (default: 4000)
  -c, --close           close window after reaching maximum iterations (default: False)
