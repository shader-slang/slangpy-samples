## Example: Toy renderer with ReSTIR

This example uses ReSTIR [1,2,3] to render the view of an animated 2D toy scene. Artificial noise is introduced
to the path contributions to model path tracing noise. Samples are reused between pixels and frames with
ReSTIR for lower-noise integration of the path tracing noise and the pixel footprint.

The sample reuse between pixels and frames is based on generalized resampled importance sampling (GRIS) [2]
with the generalized balance heuristic; this is thoroughly documented in the "Gentle Introduction to ReSTIR"
SIGGRAPH course [3]. Temporal reuse is made fully unbiased by using the prior-frame target
function in the multiple importance sampling (MIS) in resampling. Temporal reuse follows integer
motion vectors, which is not ideal, but works fine for low-frequency content [4]. The implementation is
theoretically proper, but lacks improvements like multiple spatial neighbors or G-buffer based sample
rejection in spatial reuse, which could make reuse much more robust in practice. A proper application
would further apply a high-quality denoiser to the ReSTIR output.

For context and additional information, please see the ReSTIR course "A Gentle Introduction to ReSTIR:
Path Reuse in Real-Time" (Wyman et al. 2023, [3]), https://intro-to-restir.cwyman.org/, especially the course notes.

This application outputs the ReSTIR frames to 'tev'; first 1spp frames and then ReSTIR frames.
